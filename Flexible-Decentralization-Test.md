<h1>A Flexible Legal Test of Sufficient Decentralization</h1>

<h2>General Statement of Test</h2>
<br>
An open network system is sufficiently decentralized if that system is an open network system and control over that system is widely distributed among independent persons. 

<h2>Open Network System</h2>
<br>
An open network system is a peer-to-peer network of free open-source software clients which send, receive, validate and record data states on a distributed ledger in accordance with a protocol that is enforceable and verifiable by operation of the software clients.

<h2>Detailed Statement of Test</h2> 
<br>
In general, sufficient decentralization will be found if, in light of all facts and circumstances, either: 
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>no single person or group of affiliated persons controls the open network system or the consensus, economics or software protocol/client of the open network system; or</li>
<br>
<li>if any person or group does control one or more aspects of the open network system, control over other aspects of the system is widely distributed among independent persons in a manner that substantially limits the controlling person's or group's ability to interfere with or alter the the open network system or other persons' use and enjoyment of the open network system.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Rebuttable Presumptions to be Used in Applying the Test</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling more than 20% of the native tokens of an open network system, or who own or control token-sale proceeds the fair value of which exceeds 20% of the market capitalization of such token, has or have control over the economics of the open network system.</li>
<br>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling enough of the means of block production to violate the 'honest majority' assumption applicable to the open network system has or have control over the consensus of the open network system.</li>
<br>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons controlling a software client used by more than 50% of the nodes on the network has or have over the protocol/client of the open network system.</li>
</ol>
