<h1>A Flexible Legal Test of Sufficient Decentralization</h1>

<h2>General Statement of Test</h2>
<br>
An Open Network System is sufficiently decentralized if control over that system is widely distributed among independent persons.

<h2>Open Network System</h2>
<br>
An open network system is either:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>a peer-to-peer network of free open-source software clients which send, receive, validate and record data states on a distributed ledger in accordance with a protocol that is enforceable and verifiable by operation of the software clients; or</li>
<br>
<li>software code which is recorded for execution by clients and recording of operations on the distributed ledger of a peer-to-peer network of the kind described in clause “(1)” (aka a “smart contract” or system of “smart contracts”).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Detailed Statement of Test</h2> 
<br>
In general, sufficient decentralization will be found if, in light of all facts and circumstances, either: 
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>no single person or group of affiliated persons (a “group”) controls any material component of the Open Network System; or</li>
<br>
<li>if clause “(1)” is not satisfied — i.e., if a person or group does control one or more material components of the Open Network System (but less than all of the material components)— control over the other material components is widely distributed among un-affiliated persons in a manner that substantially limits the controlling person’s or group’s power to interfere with or alter the Open Network System to directly or indirectly achieve a material benefit for the controlling person or group in a manner that would adversely affect third parties’ rights, powers, privileges, property interests or uses relating to the Open Network System.</li>
</ol>
'Material components' of an Open Network System include, without limitation, the consensus component, economic component, software protocol/client component and user component of the Open Network System. 
<br>
<h2>Rebuttable Presumptions to be Used in Applying the Test</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group owning or controlling more than 20% of the native tokens of an Open Network System, or who own or control token-sale proceeds the fair value of which exceeds 20% of the market capitalization of such token, has or have control over the economic component of the open network system.</li>
<br>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group owning or controlling enough of the means of block production to violate the ‘honest majority’ assumption applicable to the Open Network System has or have control over the consensus component of the Open Network System.</li>
<br>
<li>There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group controlling a software client used by more than 50% of the validating nodes on the Open Network System has or have control over the protocol/client component of the Open Network System.</li>
<br>
<li>For Open Network Systems consisting of smart contracts, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group with ‘administrative’ or ‘ownership’ privileges controlling parameter changes, upgrades and/or the minting or burning of tokens has or have control over the Open Network System.</li>
</ol>
